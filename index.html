      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        Ken Rolston was the lead designer for the Elder Scrolls games and
        expansions starting with Morrowind, but he left Bethesda after the
        completion of Oblivion for what was thought to be permanent retirement
        after about 25 years in the Gaming Industry. However, this only lasted
        for about a year before he returned to work for Big Huge Games in
        February of 2007 as the lead designer for Ascendant, which was
        unfortunately canceled due to THQ's (Big Huge Games's owner) financial
        difficulties. He has also designed a pair of pen-and-paper RPGs,
        Paranoia and RuneQuest. Rolston also served as the lead creative
        visionary for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, a single player RPG
        designed by 38 Studios, a Baltimore subsidiary of Big Huge Games.

        The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the fourth game in the Elder Scrolls
        series, is set within the province of Cyrodiil, the heartland and
        Imperial capital of Tamriel. Emperor Uriel Septim VII is assassinated in
        flight from his own palace, but just before he dies he passes on to
        you—the foreordained of his dreams—the mystic Amulet of Kings. The
        adventure proper begins with the quest to find Uriel's lost and
        illegitimate son—the only heir to the throne. In a world where the
        forces of darkness seek their ultimate dominion over the ranks of man
        and mer alike, you alone stand between the future of Tamriel and the
        gates of Oblivion.
